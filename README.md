# Emotion-based-music-recommendation-system
Once the user's emotional state is determined, this project plays music tracks that align with user's emotion. This is implemented by using python with Machine Learning.
Machine Learning techniques are employed to analyze the collected data and extract relevant emotional features.. By training a classification model on this data, the system can classify the user's emotional state into distinct categories, such as happy, sad, calm, or energetic. 
Based on the user's inferred emotional state, the recommendation system employs collaborative filtering techniques to suggest music tracks that match their current emotional state.
